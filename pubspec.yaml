  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/lottie/

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  #   assets:
  #     - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Galano Grotesque
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueBold.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueSemiBold.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueRegular.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueMedium.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueLight.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueThin.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/GalanoGrotesqueExtraLight.otf

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
